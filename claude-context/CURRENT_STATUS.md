## Recent Changes

### 2026-02-08 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 5
- **Updated `install.sh`** to new Notification hook format:
  - Changed from `hooks.permission_prompt` / `hooks.idle_prompt` (old deprecated format)
  - Now uses `hooks.Notification[{matcher: "permission_prompt|idle_prompt", ...}]`
  - Updated push notification instructions to use config file approach

### 2026-02-08 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 4
- **xterm.js integration** (Level 4):
  - xterm.js v5.3.0 + FitAddon + WebLinksAddon from CDN (no build step)
  - Replaced plain-text `textContent` rendering with proper terminal emulation
  - ANSI colour codes now render correctly (added `-e` flag to `tmux capture-pane`)
  - Removed hidden textarea — xterm.js manages its own input via `onData`
  - Content diffing prevents flicker on re-renders
  - Lazy initialisation — xterm only created when first prompt arrives
  - GitHub-dark theme matching existing CSS variables
- **Mobile quick-action keyboard bar** (Level 5):
  - Two-row button bar: `y` `n` `1` `2` `3` / `Enter` `Esc` `^C` `Tab` `↑` `↓`
  - 44px minimum touch targets (iOS HIG compliant)
  - Buttons call `sendKey()` directly — bypass xterm focus requirement
  - Bar appears only when prompt active, hides in empty/history states
  - Sending state greys out buttons to prevent double-sends
  - xterm.js auto-refits when bar appears/disappears

### 2026-02-08 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 3
- **Level 2: Push Alerts** — Full implementation:
  - Config file support (`~/.claude-remote/config.json`) for ntfy_topic, remote_url, quiet hours
  - Rich ntfy.sh notifications: urgent priority, action buttons (Approve, Open UI), dedup via X-Id
  - Quick-response endpoint (`GET /quick`) for one-tap responses from notification
  - Notification history endpoint (`GET /api/history`) and UI history view
  - idle_prompt notifications (configurable), quiet hours support
  - Notification tracking (`notified` field) in state files
- **WebSocket real-time updates**:
  - `ws` npm package, WebSocketServer on `/ws` path
  - `fs.watch` on pending directory with 100ms debounce
  - Automatic fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket disconnects
  - Exponential backoff reconnection, iOS Safari visibility handling
  - Status indicator: "live" (WebSocket) or "polling" (HTTP fallback)
- **Testing**:
  - Push notifications verified on iPhone (ntfy.sh topic + action buttons)
  - Fixed firewall (`ufw allow 3847/tcp`) for phone access
  - WebSocket instant updates verified (create/delete test files)
  - Improved quick-response page with visual feedback
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (e36c9f8)

### 2026-02-07 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 2
- Ran full simulated end-to-end test — all 10 steps passed
- Updated `notify.sh` for new Claude Code hook JSON format (`notification_type` field)
- Created `~/.claude/settings.json` with Notification hooks configuration
- Installed server npm dependencies
- Attempted live test — blocked by Opus concurrency limit (one session at a time)
- Hook config format changed: now uses `Notification` event with `matcher` patterns

### 2026-02-07 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 1
- Integrated extended roadmap (Levels 7-11) into project
- Created `ROADMAP.md` with full vision document (1098 lines)

### 2026-01-13 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 2
- Implemented complete Level 1 MVP (8 files, ~1,800 lines)
- Pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/fallior/clauderemote

### 2026-01-13 — Darron (via Claude) — Session 1
- Set up `claude-context/` folder structure following starter kit template
- Created full project documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md, LEVELS.md)

## What's Working

- ✅ Hook script receives notification data from Claude Code
- ✅ State files created for pending prompts
- ✅ Rich push notifications via ntfy.sh with action buttons
- ✅ One-tap response from notification (quick-response page)
- ✅ Config file for persistent settings (ntfy topic, remote URL, quiet hours)
- ✅ Express server serves web UI, API, and WebSocket
- ✅ Terminal mirror UI shows live tmux pane content
- ✅ Keystroke forwarding to Claude Code via tmux
- ✅ WebSocket real-time push (instant prompt updates)
- ✅ Automatic fallback to HTTP polling if WebSocket drops
- ✅ Notification history in web UI
- ✅ tmux session management via `claude-remote` CLI
- ✅ xterm.js terminal emulation with ANSI colour rendering
- ✅ Mobile quick-action keyboard bar (y/n/1-3/Enter/Esc/^C/Tab/arrows)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Next Session)
- [x] Update `install.sh` to use new hook format — Done (2026-02-08)
- [x] Set up Tailscale — Done (2026-02-09), IP: 100.82.63.83
- [ ] Test Tailscale from iPhone (install app, test on mobile data)
- [ ] Refine UI based on continued mobile usage

### Short-term
- [ ] Level 3: Context Window — scrollable history, search, syntax highlighting
- [ ] Level 6: Claude Bridge — direct API integration, multi-line input

## Known Issues

| Issue | Severity | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `idle_prompt` 60s delay | Medium | Built into Claude Code; can't be reduced |
| iOS Safari drops WebSocket in background | Low | Handled by visibilitychange reconnect + polling fallback |
| Opus concurrency limit | Low | Can't run two Claude Code Opus sessions simultaneously |

## Blockers

*None currently*

## Questions to Resolve

- [x] Best way to handle multiple simultaneous Claude Code sessions? → `claude-remote-$$` naming
- [x] Should web UI auto-refresh or use WebSocket? → WebSocket with polling fallback
- [x] How to handle ntfy.sh action buttons on private networks? → Use `view` actions (opens on phone browser, which is on LAN)
